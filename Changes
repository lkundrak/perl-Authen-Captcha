	* Changes: updated changes - tagged as Rel-1_023

2003-12-17 23:44  jmiller

	* Captcha.pm, t/1.t: Added keep_failures option, to keep the
	captcha around when the check failes one wants.  Added initial
	untested sound file support (no distortion yet)

2003-12-04 15:50  jmiller

	* Changes: updated changes - tagged as Rel-1_022

2003-12-04 15:46  jmiller

	* Captcha.pm: removed item from TODO - fixing srand() portability

2003-12-04 15:44  jmiller

	* Captcha.pm: added data validation to expire(), width(), and
	height() to verify set's use a possitive integer.  check_code() -
	have it creating database file codes.txt if it doesn't exist (touch
	it).

2003-12-04 15:25  jmiller

	* Captcha.pm, Makefile.PL, t/1.t: Portability update.  Modified
	directory/file handling to use File::Spec for portable operations. 
	Added warnings for when unlink's failed.  Made srand() in new() of
	Captcha.pm more portable.

2003-12-04 11:08  jmiller

	* t/1.t: adjusted test t/1.t... it was writing captcha out to
	/tmp/captcha_temp/etc, changed it to use t/captcha_temp/etc using
	__FILE__ to figure out where the test is at.

2003-12-04 00:45  jmiller

	* Captcha.pm, Makefile.PL, t/1.t: Removed nasty hack to hardcode in
	the lib/Authen/Captcha/images directory. Replaced with the solution
	that lib/Net/Config.pm uses (thanks to Andrew Savige for helping me
	out). The new solution uses __FILE__ to find the module's filename,
	and regex's it into the path to the images directory.

2003-12-03 22:12  jmiller

	* Captcha.pm, examples/wwwtest.cgi, t/1.t: MAJOR INTERFACE CHANGE!
	method names have changed. All two word method names have been
	lowercased and split with an underscore for propper style and
	consistency:	datafolder	=> data_folder	outputfolder	=>
	output_folder	     imagesfolder    => images_folder	    
	generateCode	=> generate_code	checkCode	=>
	check_code Also, though less important, an audit of all variable
	names in the module has been done in order to put them into the
	correct naming conventions as well.

2003-12-03 21:53  jmiller

	* Captcha.pm: added TODO to docs

2003-12-03 15:21  jmiller

	* Captcha.pm, Makefile.PL: added PREREQ_PM's to the Makefile.PL,
	fixed docs on requirements (GD doesn't have to be a 2.x release, I
	have it working fine on a 1.41 GD)

2003-11-15 07:11  jmiller

	* branched off of "FirstProductions Human Test 1.0"
		- http://www.firstproductions.com/cgi/human/
		- it's a "perl library" that can be require'd into other scripts
		  but was written with many globals with hardcoded configs
		  and poor structure.
