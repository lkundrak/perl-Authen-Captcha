This is the readme file for the example scripts.

wwwtest.cgi 
-----------
Functional as a cgi-script or in a mod_perl setup.
To install (on a machine with Authen::Captcha installed):
- copy it to your cgi-bin
- modify permissions so that it is executable:
	chmod a+rx wwwtest.cgi
- edit the script, setting the variables at it's top to
  appropriate values:
	$output_dir : should be set to a directory that is within your
	              DocumentRoot. This directory must be writable by
	              the web server user, eg:
	              chgrp apache /var/www/html/captcha
	              chmod g+rwx /var/www/html/captcha
	$www_output_dir : should be set to where the $output_dir maps 
	                  to the outside world. In the above example,
	                  if /var/www/html is the DocumentRoot, 
	                  $www_output_dir should be set to '/captcha'
	$db_dir : should be set to a directory that is NOT accessable
	          from the web, and is writable by the web server user.
	$num_of_characters : controls how many characters will be displayed
	                     in the resulting Captcha.
- Pull up the script in a browser, and test it. If it doesn't work,
  check your web server log files.
